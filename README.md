# React Wordle

This is a assignment sample project of the popular maths expression guessing game we all know and love. Made using React, Typescript, and Tailwind.



## Build and run

### To Run Locally:

Clone the repository and perform the following command line actions:

```bash
$> cd benesse-int-app
$> npm install
$> npm run start
```
###

This sample project instead of working on a pre-defined set of words has a
random expression generator for the 8 word nerdle game. And as the
expressions are generated dynamically, developer gives you the choice to play
this as many times a day you want.
